# Anomalies Detectector Web App
### General
In this project, we built a web application , which allows us inspect  flight-related data and showing the flight's anomalies.
The project includes MVC  architecture,Client-Server architecture, and unsynchronized programming.

### Emphasis for examiner
- ##### We completed the project according to the second version of the exercise.
- #### dll asumptions
  - We assumed the app is runnning on 64-bit system, we also included a x86 win32 versions of the dlls in the controller so you can change the name of the loaded dll in the server file accroding to your system.
  - We changed the threshold value in the mincircle algorithm, to detect more anomalies.  
- To watch the results of the anomalies, you need to press the Upload, and after the calculation is done, press the Show\ Refresh Results button.

### Repositories structure
- Controller folder - contains the server and  the dll files of the minimal circle and the regression line algorithms.
- Model folder - contains the anomalies model which is responsible to run the currect dll file with the given csv files.
- View folder - contains the index.html file that is the GUI of the app.
The GUI offers the following options:
	- Upload  train and test csv files.
	- Choose a detection algorithm from the algorithms menu.
	- View the detected anomalies in a user's-friendly format.
  
- #### dll logic
  In order to work with dll files we did as follows:
  - We used a node.js library calls "ffi-napi".
  - the "ffi-napi" library allowed us to load the dll file and the "findAnomalies()" function from inside the dll.
  - We wrapped our dll function in a async function.
  - We called  the method which used the flight data stored in the input.txt to be loaded, processed, detect anomalies and write them into the output.txt file.

- ### Client
	 For user story 2 - we created a python client that sends a http POST request to our server using the library "requests" that is supported in Python 3.7.1

	 before running the client make sure that "requests" library exists on the current python and of course run the server before running the client.
	 If the "requests" library doesn't exist(isn't supported on every python version) run in the cmd the line: py -m pip install requests or/and the line: py -verNum -m pip install requests (that verNum is the current version number of python. for example for python 3.9 - the line: py -3.9 -m pip install requests).


### Packages requirements
- In order to continue developing the project, the following packages must be installed :
	- Controller:
		- express
		- express-fileupload
		- node-gyp
	- Model:
		- ffi-napi


### Installing Instructions
- Clone the repo
- Install the packages
- Make sure that the python and visual studio c++ build environment is up to date.
